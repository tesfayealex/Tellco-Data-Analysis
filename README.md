## Overview

<p>
An investor is interested in purchasing TellCo (a telecommunication company), an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCoâ€™s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems.
This project aims to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  We will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. We will deliver insights that we managed to extract to the employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
